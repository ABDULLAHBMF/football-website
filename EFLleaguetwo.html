		The English Football League Two (often referred to as League Two for short or Sky Bet League Two for sponsorship purposes,and known as the Football League Two from 2004 until 2016) 
		is the third and lowest division of the English Football League (EFL) and fourth-highest division overall in the English football league system.
		At the end of each season the top three teams, together with the winner of the play-offs between the teams which finished in the fourth to seventh positions, 
		are promoted to EFL League One and are replaced by the four teams that finished at the bottom of that division.
		Technically a team can be reprieved from relegation if the team replacing them does not have a ground suitable for League football, 
		but in practice this is a non-factor because every team currently in the National League has a ground that meets the League criteria 
		(and even if they did not, a ground-sharing arrangement with another team could be made until their stadium was upgraded). 
		The other way that a team can be spared relegation is if another team either resigns or is expelled from the EFL.
