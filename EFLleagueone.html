		The English Football League One (often referred to as League One for short or Sky Bet League One for sponsorship purposes, and known as the Football League One from 2004 
		until 2016)is the second-highest division of the English Football League and the third tier overall in the entire English football league system.
		At the end of each season the top two clubs, together with the winner of the play-offs between the clubs which finished in the third to sixth positions,
		are promoted to EFL Championship and are replaced by the three clubs that finished at the bottom of that division.
		Similarly, the four clubs that finished at the bottom of EFL League One are relegated to EFL League Two and are replaced by the top three clubs and
		the club that won the fourth to seventh place play-offs in that division.
